            <p>Hi there. My name is Thomas Hoyt. I am born and raised here in Colorado, which is fun to see all the changes that are going on in my backyard from the diverse group of people that love to call Colorado home now. I grew up as a very active kid that always wanted
              to be outside and doing something. Though it may have gotten me in trouble as a kid, it has carried over to my adult life. I love sports and being outdoors as much as possible. I wanted to become a web developer because of the unique and challenging oppurtunity it 
              presents to those who master it. Its a creative outlet that takes years of practice and keyboard work to become advance (so I'm sorry if my work is still choppy!) In the end i hope to be a good junior developer and be hitting the job market in no time!
            </p>
